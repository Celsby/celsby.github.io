# Ul'dah Introduction (Patch 1.0)

## Drama in Ul'dah

The adventurer who would become the warrior of light's arrives in Ul'dah by chocobo carriage. The city of Ul'dah is a bustling mercantile town. Well-to-do citizens haggle in the markets, ruffians skulk in alleyways, and many workers are abuzz preparing for a parade later in the day. Disembarking from the carriage, an unfamiliar voice\[^2\] entreats the adventurer to "Hear... Feel... Think..."

Suddenly the sky fills with burning meteors, crashing down from the heavens, but only for a moment.\[^2\] Staring up into the sky, the adventurer's concentration is broken by a young girl excitedly announcing to her father that there are fireworks in the sky. The adventurer's vision shifts, revealing an ordinary sky lit up by the fireworks display. We also catch a glimpse of a tall white-haired man with an unusual tattoo on his neck,\[^3\] armed with daggers, he seems out-of-place on this otherwise joyous day.

The adventurer takes in the city as the parade is nearly underway. They spot a kindly white-hair miqo'te woman handing out flowers to all the children and even some of the adults. She bends down, placing one in the cap of the young girl from earlier, who seems surprised and elated to receive the same gift that every other child around her has received. The adventurer overhears her name--Ascilia--as well as the miqo'te woman F'lhaminn.

Quickly the parade is underway featuring a captured and ensorcelled goobbue as its centerpiece, but the tattooed man takes up a spot next to the adventurer and says he's much more interested in the Songstresses of Ul'dah with a creepy "flowers _do_ bloom in the desert" line. Ew Thancred keep it in your pants.

The festivities come to an abrupt end as a mammet blows a horn that enrages the goobbue who breaks free from its aetherial bindings with an angry roar,\[^4\] sending the thaumaturge binding it flying into a wall with a sickening crunch. Onlookers begin to flee in a panic as the city guard are nowhere to be found. The goobbue proceeds to cause some general mayhem throughout Ul'dah before the adventurer and the tattooed man put it down. 

Catching their breath, the adventurer and the tattooed man--Thancred--have but a moment to celebrate their victory before the goobbue rises once again and charges straight at Ascilia. In a dramatic moment, Ascilia's father dives toward her, pushing her out of the way, and taking the full force of the goobbue's charge. Both Ascilia's father and the goobbue are left dead. The adventurer has only been in Ul'dah for a few hours at most and already a man is dead and a young girl is orphaned.

It's only going to get worse from here unfortunately.

\[^1\] No seriously it's a very different voiceover for Hydaelyn and the voice actress sounds incredibly bored with the lines.

\[^2\] I had no idea that the event in Shadowbringers where Elidibus grants a bunch of would-be adventurers the Echo would have its roots going this far back.

\[^3\] As with Hydaelyn, Thancred's voice actor sounds like he absolutely hates everything about doing this.

\[^4\] The implication later on is that this was caused by either an Ascian or a Garlean conspiracy to sow discord in Ul'dah.
